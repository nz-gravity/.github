# Welcome to NZ-Gravity ðŸŒŒ

Welcome to the GitHub organization of the **New Zealand Astrostatistics and General Relativity Working Group (NZ-Gravity)**.

## About Us

NZ-Gravity is an inter-institutional and cross-disciplinary association of astrophysicists and data scientists with a shared interest in **gravitational waves**, **data analysis**, and **astrostatistics**. Our members span multiple institutions across New Zealand, collaborating to advance research and development in these fields.

We are proud members of the **International LISA Consortium**, led by the European Space Agency (ESA), which focuses on the Laser Interferometer Space Antenna (LISA) mission â€” the first space-based gravitational wave observatory.

## What We Do

Our GitHub organization hosts code developed by members of NZ-Gravity, ranging from:
- **Gravitational wave data analysis**
- **Statistical modeling and data science tools**
- **Signal processing algorithms**
- **Machine learning and variational inference** for astrostatistics
- **General relativity simulations**

These tools support research into detecting and analyzing gravitational waves, modeling astrophysical phenomena, and addressing challenges at the interface of astrophysics and statistics.

## Repositories

Explore our repositories to find tools and code contributions from our members. Some highlights include:
- **[SGVB_PSD](https://nz-gravity.github.io/sgvb_psd/)**: A package for estimating the power spectral density (PSD) of correlated multivariate detector noise using variational inference.
- **[Starcatto](https://starccato.github.io/starccato)**: A package for training and using a GAN (Generative Adversarial Network) to generate synthetic GW signals from Stellar core collapse events.
- **Other research-related software**: Coming soon!

## How to Contribute

We welcome contributions! If you're a member of the NZ-Gravity group or someone with an interest in astrostatistics or gravitational wave science, feel free to:
